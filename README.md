# TipCalculator
"Quick Tip" calculator project to practice JavaScript.

This is a project taken from @chrisdixon161 (on Twitter) "fun-javascript-projects" course. Honestly, I came for the JavaScript practice but I also learned a few things about CSS that I never knew about(such as using label, input, box-shadow inset)!

For the JS: variables, functions, Math.ceil, if statement, and DOM manipulation were used.

This was a super fun begineer project that I enjoyed doing :)
